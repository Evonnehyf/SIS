# SIS
(Iterative) Sure Independence Screening for Generalized Linear Models and Cox's Proportional Hazards Models:

Variable selection techniques are essential tools for model selection and estimation in high-dimensional statistical models. Through this publicly available ```R``` package, we provide a unified environment to carry out variable selection using iterative sure independence screening (SIS) and all of its variants in generalized linear models and the Cox proportional hazards model.
